# 10XQC

### A website to collect quality statistics from 10X single cell data.

**See the website at http://10xqc.com**

This tool was developed to allow users of 10X Genomics single-cell 3'mRNA-seq technology to share their experiences. By uploading some simple metadata from your experiment's Cell Ranger report you can gain access to a pool of knowledge, compare your run against others that have used similar experimental conditions, and determine how well your experiment has worked.
